## Need to do
- save word
  - saving word works
    - word is saved if user does not solve it
    - if user solves it then word will change after reload
  - still need to save guesses
    - working on this right now
    - almost done
- larger word bank
  - needs to be bigger but ok for now
  - could be used to catch invalid words but word bank too small for that right now
